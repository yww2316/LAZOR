# LAZOR
The github repository for the LAZOR Project. Once one clones this github repository, one can use the SolveLAZOR.py file to solve any LAZOR puzzle located in the bff_files folder. To change the .bff file solved, one must run the SolveLAZOR.py file and enter the name of the desired .bff file in the designated user input in the terminal. One must ensure that they add the .bff extension at the end of the desired .bff file name. Once one runs the python file, the terminal will output the initial grid, the solved grid, and the time taken to find the solved grid. The solved grid output will include the positions and blocks, represented by A, B, C, that should be at those given positions. The format of the solved grid will look very similiar to the grid given in the .bff file.
